  this week was really interesting for us. we started to implement our app prototype which is of course a big step closer to our goal. we still try not to rush and take it one step at a time as we did before. this includes making a class diagram.
in the following picture you can see how we did this for our workout-edit screene and how we imagine to implement the single workouts later.
