  This week was really interesting for us. We started to implement some of our features to our app prototype. Which is now of course a big step closer to our final goal. We still try not to rush and take it one step at a time, just as we did before. This includes making a class diagrams for now.
In the following picture you can see how we did this for our workout-edit screen and how we plan to implement the workouts later.

We hope you liked our short insight into what we are working on at the moment. 
  This is just a brief teaser, while in the next blogs you will learn more about our progress on the final app.

  All the best,<br><br>
