  this week was really interesting for us. we started to implement our app prototype which is of course a big step closer to our goal. we still try not to rush and take it one step at a time as we did before. this includes making a class diagram.
in the following picture you can see how we did this for our workout-edit screene and how we imagine to implement the single workouts later.

we hope to give you a short insight into what we are working on at the moment. 
  in the next blogs you will also learn more and more about our progress on the app.

  <br><br>
  <br><br>
  All the best,<br><br>

  Your workout-log team!<br><br><br><br><br>
