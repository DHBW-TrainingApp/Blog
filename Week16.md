  This week was all about refactoring. We were supposed to download a repository on github and refactor the example code with the help of a book   
  (http://silab.fon.bg.ac.rs/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Refactoring-Improving-the-Design-of-Existing-Code-Addison-Wesley-Professional-1999.pdf ) 
  and upload this to our own repository on github. The book and the methods in it were supposed to show us how to refactor cleverly using the example. 
  The book also taught us how to cleverly shorten or move code to get a better overview. In the end, it was a matter of applying what we had learned 
  with the help of the examples in the book.
  You can find our repositories at https://github.com/Sebastian-Zok/FowlerRefactoring (Sebastian) and https://github.com/0Raspbinary1/SE_Refactoring (Rouven). 
  The original repository can be found here: https://github.com/gnilkreb/Fowler
  <br><br><br>
  Additionally we have 2 useful refactoring functions for you, which you can use (in the IDE Eclipse): <br><br>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Using Autoformat Code <br> 
  With the Autoformat function you can keep track of your code and find it faster in case of an error. Since Eclipse is available for several 
  operating systems, the shortcut here is different:<br>
  To format code using the Autoformat function on Windows, press [CTRL]+[SHIFT]+[F] simultaneously. Under MacOS you use the key combination [CMD]+SHIFT]+[F].</li>
  
  <li>Using Rename<br>
  Rename can be used when you decide to rename a variable for example. The key combination [CTRL]+[SHIFT]+[r] can be used to rename the variable, 
    at any point where it has been used.</li>
  </ul>

  <br><br>
  All the best,<br><br>

  Your workout-log team!<br><br><br><br><br>
