Since we already reported on our project last time, today we are introducing you to our features that we 
  want to implement in our app and which technology we will use for it. 
<br>
<br>
Starting with our main objective, we'd like you to be able to track your personal fitness progresses.
<br><br>
In order to achive this we want to implement the following features:
<br>
<ol>
<li>create your personalized training schedule</li>
<li>see a statistic of your progress (weight etc.)</li>
<li>achieve challenges or create your own</li>
<li>have a calendar to plan your workouts or challenges</li>
</ol><br>

Furthermore, we thought about features which would be nice to have:
<br><br>
<ol>
<li>User-Management-System</li>
<li>possibility to follow other people</li>
<li>being able to share your progress</li>
<li>meal planning and tracking your nutritional values</li>
<li>track your walking distance</li>
</ol>
<br><br>

<h1>Technologies</h1>

For the frontend we will use Cordova, Ionic, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Angular.

Especially for the additional functions we also need a backend. Here we will use Node.js, MongoDB/SQL and Firebase.

Angular is a platform for building mobile and desktop web applications.
Apache Cordova is a mobile application development framework created by Nitobi.
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
Cordova wraps your HTML/JavaScript app into a native container which can access the device functions of several platforms.
Ionic Framework is an app development platform which build amazing cross-platform mobile, web, and desktop apps all with one shared code base and open-web standards.

<br><br><br>
  
We look forward to realize our ideas and welcome your feedback.<br><br>

All the best,<br><br>

Your workout-log team!<br><br><br><br><br>
