 "Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will."
  
This week we created the feature files for two of our cases
This task was very helpful to understand better how we want to implement these features later.
The process of creating the feature files also helped the team to get an overall understanding of 
what needs to be done for the features and how much needs to be done for even very simple features<br><br>
  
This one is for creating new workouts or editing existing ones. You can find more to it <a href="https://github.com/DHBW-TrainingApp/Blog/blob/main/docs/UCs/createWorkout.md">here</a><br><br>

The second one deals with the procedure of a started interactive workout. The link towards this Use Case Specification is: <a href="https://github.com/DHBW-TrainingApp/Blog/blob/main/docs/UCs/Training.md">Click here </a><br><br>
