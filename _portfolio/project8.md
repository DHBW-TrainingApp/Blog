  ¨If it doesn't challange you, it doesn't change you.¨ – Fred Devito
  
  <br><br>
  
  In this blog, we want to look a bit behind the internal scenes. What's going well, what's not and more.

  The first thing we want to address is the communication among us. This works very well. We meet every week and exchange ideas, discuss further functional         details or general topics concerning the workout-log project. 

  The implementation of the previous weeks, respectively the implementation goals, works well so far. Everyone in our group has currently been assigned a fixed     task that relates to the implementation.
  
  Time?
  

  <br>
  <br><br>
  All the best,<br><br>

  Your workout-log team!<br><br><br><br><br>
