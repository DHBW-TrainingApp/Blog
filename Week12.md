  „Der Wille ist stärker als das Können." ― Kevin Constantine
  
  <br><br><br><br>
  In order to keep all our files bundled, we created our risk table inside the knowledge base of our YouTrack Project. Here's the link: https://dhbw-karlsruhe.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/articles/WL-A-1/RISK-MANAGEMENT
  <br>
  
  This week we created a table that provides an overview of our risk management.  
  The table contains the name of the risk with its corresponding description, the probability of occurrence and impact, some risk mitigation and the person(s) that are in charge of it. <br><br>
  
  The first and most serious risk is about dependency issues. Because through the use of dependencies you become dependant on them and it can happen that they get removed (left-pad) or are changed / updated in such a way that the code in the backend and 
  frontend needs to be adapted. We declared the risk factor here as 3, but through the use of for e.g. GitHub's dependabot tool as risk mitigation, we can minimize this risk.  
  Dependabot is designed to throw up warnings for repositories when security vulnerabilities 
  or problems occur in dependencies. <br><br>
  
  General security problems can be caused by configuration errors within Firebase. The risk 
  factor here is 2.5. For problem mitigation we could use a security checker, firebase authentication 
  and manual testing. <br><br>
  
  Another risk is to underestimate the effort required to develop features for our app. This bias of self-esteem is
  also known as the Dunning-Krueger effect and of course every developer can relate to it :). But still we declared the risk factor as a solid 1.2, because for prevention we use agile working methods, conduct better/longer and are doing more detailed research and monthly retrospectives. We are curious how this risk will conclude in our final retrospective. <br><br>
  
  Also, we may receive an unexpected bill from Firebase. This can be caused by using Firebase 
  incorrectly, using up all of our free credit very quickly. The risk factor is a 0.4. To avoid 
  this we use a backup to be able to save the data in case of account suspension. In addition to that, 
  while testing we can use multiple Google accounts to store more data in total (More accounts = more free credits). Regularly checking the inbox is also 
  important to get important information, such as a upcoming account suspension. <br><br>
  
  The last risk we have is the incorrect display of our app on different devices. This can 
  happen if the app has been programmed poorly and therefore cannot be displayed correctly 
  on certain devices. The risk factor is 0.18. In order to prevent this, the documentation 
  of the technologies that are used should be read from the beginning (*laughing*), so that possible errors
  can be prevented in advance.

  All the best,<br><br>
