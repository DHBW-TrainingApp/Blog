  „Der Wille ist stärker als das Können." ― Kevin Constantine
  
  <br><br>
  
  This week we have created a table that provides an overview of risk management.  
  The table contains the name of the risk, the description, the probability of occurrence, 
  the impact, the factor, the risk mitigation and the person(s) responsible for it. <br><br>
  The first risk we have is dependency issues. It can happen that the technological dependencies 
  no longer exist or are changed / updated in such a way that the code in the backend and 
  frontend must be adapted.

  <br><br>
  All the best,<br><br>

  Your workout-log team!<br><br><br><br><br>
