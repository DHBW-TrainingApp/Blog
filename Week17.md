Welcome to another Workout-Log blog post! <br>
This week, we are going to have a look on software design patterns and principles. Both are a crucial part of refactoring for an improved software quality maintainability and readability. But of course they are not an ultimate solution  and should be carefully considered before implementing. 

  
  <br><br>
  
  Sidefact: Read the whole article, if you want to know why this Blogpost comes so late (Monday 0 oâ€™clock).
  
    <br><br>
  Here is a great video about design patterns every developer should know: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv-_1er1mWI
  
      <br><br>
For example, hereâ€™s a short explanation of the Singleton Pattern: an Singleton is an object that can only be initiated once and this instance is accessed globally. This makes the Singleton pattern perfect for logging activities and is more efficient than always directly using the systems filesystem. Unfortunately, the Singleton pattern does not count for the homework, so we must look at another design pattern.

<br><br>
 So in the following section weâ€™are going to have a look on the prototype pattern: The prototype is a creational Pattern, and its concept is quite similar to the inheritance concept from object oriented programming, but instead of inheriting from an class, a prototype inherits from an object that has already been created. This makes it much easier to share functionality between objects and especially in a dynamic language like JavaScript. Prototypes are also already supported by JavaScript out of the box, so the implementation shouldnâ€™t be a problem for us since our tech stack is using typescript. 
  
  <br><br>
  In our example we have a function for an Array which is filled with activities. This function then calculates the sums for each day and puts them in the right position of the array. Instead of calling the function we now want to make a Prototype of the Array Object and add a method for this purpose. Another function for the Array Object that we could consider by implementing as a prototype, would be our custom sorting function, but for the begin we stick with the first one.
  <br><br>
  So next we are going to show you why our blog post needed so long. And as you can see in the examples below,  we didnâ€™t manage to get the prototype to work in our typescript environment. Fells like a deja-vu with the unit-testing homework.  
    <br><br>
  
    Original function:
  {% highlight js linenos %}

  calculateDateSums() {
      let days = [];
      let date = new Date(this.Tasks[0].date).toDateString();
      let protein = 0;
      let kcal = 0;
      for (let i = 0; i < this.Tasks.length; i++) {
        let element = this.Tasks[i];
        if (element.type === 'meal') {
          if (new Date(element.date).toDateString() == date) {
            if (!isNaN(Number(element.protein))) {
              protein += Number(element.protein);
            }

            if (!isNaN(Number(element.energy))) {
              kcal += Number(element.energy);
            }
          } else {
            days.push({
              type: 'date',
              index: i + days.length,
              energy: kcal.toString(),
              protein: protein.toString(),
            });
            if (!isNaN(Number(element.protein))) {
              protein = Number(element.protein);
            } else {
              protein = 0;
            }

            if (!isNaN(Number(element.energy))) {
              kcal = Number(element.energy);
            } else {
             kcal = 0;
            }
            date = new Date(element.date).toDateString();
         }
        }
      }
      let index = 0;
      days.forEach((element) => {
        this.Tasks.splice(index, 0, element);
        index = element.index + 1;
      });
    }

{% endhighlight %}  <br><br>

  Now we simply wanted to implement the code in a prototype function of the Array Object, just like this example is doing it with the String Object: 
  <br><br>
    {% highlight js linenos %}
interface String {
  toSlug(): string;
}

String.prototype.toSlug = function () {
  var str = this.toLowerCase();
  str = str.replace(
    /!|@|%|\^|\*|\(|\)|\+|\=|\<|\>|\?|\/|,|\.|\:|\;|\'| |\"|\&|\#|\[|\]|~|$|_/g,
    ' '
  );
  return str.trim();
};


{% endhighlight %}  <br><br>

  But neither the example or our own implementation seemed to work. <br>

Thatâ€™s why we tried it with the defineProperty Method like in the other example below, but also this didnâ€™t work.
<br><br>
    {% highlight js linenos %}

  Object.defineProperty(Array.prototype, 'crandom', {
  value: function () {
    let index = Math.floor(Math.random() * this.length);

    return this[index];
  },
});
interface Array<T> {
  crandom(): T;
}

{% endhighlight %}  <br><br>
  
  Through importing the JS Array implementation in our app.module and adding the new method to the interface, we managed to remove all the errors from our IDE. But it didnâ€™t seemed to compile ;( <br><br>
  

So, are we now sad that it didnâ€™t worked out for us? Not really, just the lost time is a shame ðŸ˜Š. Failing with the refactoring wasn't that bad because using the prototype would be some sort of cool and elegant in a way, but itâ€™s a bad programming practice, because you create a possible opportunity for side effects with other packages. Thatâ€™s why prototypes in JS should be avoided anyways.  <br><br>

So in the end we still have some sort of happy end, especially while considering this quote: <br> 
  
 > You may also use a pattern and explain why in the normal world
 > (outside a classroom where you need to show that you can refactor with a pattern)
 > you would not have put this pattern.
