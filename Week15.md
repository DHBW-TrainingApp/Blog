This week we had another retroperspective. We sat together again and talked about some things and additionally got a lecture from a speaker about Scrum and so on. 
<br><br>
Like last time, we were again divided into four groups, which included several project groups. 
<br><br>
This time it was on the one hand about which successes we had with our project so far and how we celebrated them.  At this point we mentioned the good progress in app development in general and also that we are slowly getting the hang of using YouTrack! :D Looking at the first retroperspective, where we praised the tech stack and the project itself and defined it as "running great", it's also nice to see from our side that we kept this line and are still happy to have chosen this project. The homework, the blogposts as well as the communication is still running very well and without any problems in our opinion. In the meantime, we are unfortunately one member less, but still it works well so far. <br><br>

On the other hand, today was still about the topics that we have fallen the hardest. Among other things, we mentioned the organization and the management tool YouTrack. The problems with YouTrack were already mentioned during the first retrospective and were marked as needing improvement - in this respect, however, we think we have made enormous progress. We also included the loss of one team member, as this was of course an adjustment at the beginning and we had to settle in as a two-person team.  Continuing, last week we had problems with the tests that we were supposed to implement or create. Our framework / backend Firebase made this a bit difficult, but we still managed. We also listed the start after the semester break. Since we didn't do anything on the project for the entire time, we had to get back into the material, which of course took a bit of time. <br><br>

As a next step we should explain what and how we want to improve or do differently in the future when we start a project again.  The two most important measures would be to set a smaller target and to invest a better and more intensive training in the project. Since we did not expect the loss of a member and therefore the time for the implementation of all goals was quite short, we should therefore be a bit more cautious in the future in terms of goal definition and rather set partial goals that are most likely to be achievable. Another measure is to invest time in the setup of the project management. In the beginning, we let Youtrack slide a bit and were not really active there - but that has improved! <br><br>

From the agile project, we learned how to properly handle and use project management tools and what it brings to the overview and collaboration. Likewise, it is important to maintain good communication from the beginning and to have good project planning. Finally, in terms of implementation, the setup is also important to avoid having to add any tests afterwards. If these are relevant (actually in every larger and serious project), it is no fun to worry about good and functional tests afterwards. <br><br>

  
<br><br>
All the best,<br><br>

Your workout-log team!<br><br><br><br><br>
