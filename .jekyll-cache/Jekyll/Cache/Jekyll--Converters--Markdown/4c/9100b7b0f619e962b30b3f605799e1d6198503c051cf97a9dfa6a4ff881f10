Due to the fact that the gyms had to close because of Corona, we came to the taste of bodyweight exercises. Compared to classical strength training with isolated exercises, the emphasis is on intermuscular coordination. Thus, in exercises such as the "planche" or coordinated "pullups" different muscle groups cooperate to maintain balance, which improves the stability of the body. Also, by eliminating weights the risk of injury is lower, same as the risk of muscular imbalance. Calisthenics can be performed anywhere and did not require expensive memberships or equipment. Perfect during Corona. For three quarters of a year now, some of us have been doing calisthenics actively and with focus, several times a week. In this time we could already celebrate some successes, but we also made many typical beginner mistakes. And this is where our planned app "workout-log" comes in. 
We would summarize the biggest mistakes under the following points: 

1. No progressive progress
2. Too short trinig pauses
3. Too easy training
4. Eating too much, too unhealthy
5. Eating too little
